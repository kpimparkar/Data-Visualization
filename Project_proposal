## Abstract 
> Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet water demand. 
It affects every continent and was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as
one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade.
Two-thirds of the global population (4 billion people) live under conditions of 
severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year. Half a billion people in 
the world face severe water scarcity all year round. Half of the world’s 
largest cities experience water scarcity.

Water is essential for all living beings. Human race relies on water for 
drinking needs, food, medicine, electricity, manufacturing among other needs. 
Access to clean water is a basic need for humans. Water sources and reservoirs 
have played vital role in the development of human cultures.  

Even though water plays such an important role in the existence and development 
of human beings, we are currently facing grave problems of water scarcity and 
drought risks. Communicating this  risk to wider audience is now of more 
importance than even before. 

Science direct explains the problem of water scarcity by taking into 
consideration the impact of human water consumption, natural factors and 
current context of this problem:

> Water scarcity arises in situations where there is insufficient water to 
simultaneously support both human and ecosystem water needs (White, 2014). Most 
often this arises as a result of a basic lack of water (i.e., physical 
water scarcity), but it may also result from a lack of suitable infrastructure 
to provide access to what might otherwise be considered ample available water 
resources, which is referred to as economic water scarcity. Physical water 
scarcity may occur as a result of both natural phenomena (e.g., aridity, drought) 
as well as from human influences (e.g., desertification, water storage; Pereira 
et al., 2009; White, 2014), although these influences are often coupled. 
For example, the process of desertification often commences as a result of water
overuse during periods of temporary drought; droughts are more common in arid 
regions (McMahon et al., 1992).

This visualization project aims to convey these risks to the audience to create 
awareness about water shortage and the importance of water conservation. The 
project will visualize the water scarcity data from various sources to 
demonstrate the adverse conditions of water shortage and drought. 
 
## Motivation
Around 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water and there are huge water 
reservoirs such as rivers, lakes, glaciers around us. But still we are facing 
water scarcity. Countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, China, Syria have 
faced very severe impact of drought.[[2]](https://www.wri.org/blog/2015/06/global-tour-7-recent-droughts)

> A mere 0.014% of all water on Earth is both fresh and easily accessible. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and 
a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. 
However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by climate change) resulting in some very wet and some very dry 
geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a water crisis. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.

Water scarcity and drought have huge ecological and sociological impact. 
These conditions affect various aspects of human life, such as[[3]](http://www.eschooltoday.com/global-water-scarcity/effects-of-water-shortage.html):  

**Health**  
Water scarcity forces the community to use less clean or even contaminated 
water for drinking, cooking. This has direct impact on overall health of 
individuals of the society. Water is important for cleaning process as well. 
Shortage of water results in sanitation and cleanliness related problems.    

**Food production**  
Water is used in irrigation of crops. Additionally, water is used in processing 
and production of packaged food. Water scarcity has direct impact on these 
processes resulting in lower food production.  

**Poverty**  
In societies where agriculture is the main industry providing jobs and income
 to individuals, the impact of water shortage is very threatening. Community 
 spends most of the time in search of clean water than on betterment of the 
 society.    

One of the factor that motivated me to perform analysis on the topic of water
 scarcity and droughts is the socioeconomic impact this problem has on 
 agriculture based countries like India. Agriculture sector is the only 
 livelihood to the two-third of India's population which gives employment to 
 the  57% of work force and is a raw material source to large number of 
 industries. Impact of droughts on the lives of Indian farmers is so deep 
 that it has resulted in suicides of farmers at an epidemic proportions.
 Suicides among farmer community is a major concern in various state of India. 
 Approximately 3.4 million cotton farmers occupy a small region in India 
 call "Vidarbha" and 95% of them struggle with massive debt [[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738339/). Incidence
  of farmers ending their lives in this region had hit epidemic like proportions recently.
> In a country of 70 million farmers, it is 10 in every 100,000 farmers
committing suicide. This is higher than the total national suicide rate. The 
number of farmers committing suicide in India is more than twice of the total
 number of suicides being committed in the top 100 countries on the suicide 
 list! This indeed is worrying factor. The Government's measures including 
 waiving off loans, construction of dams, and other assisting measures have 
 not produced positive results so far.

This is visualization project is an effort to emphasize on the *need for 
action*. Every important decision made by us depends on relevant data. In 
order to convey the wide spread nature of the water scarcity and drought 
risks to global leaders, it is necessary that this data is represented in an
 objective manner. In order to represent the data in an objective manner, 
 this project relies on the Aqueduct™ water risk framework provided by World 
 Resources Institute [[1]](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct).

> WRI’s Aqueduct™ information platform compiles advances in hydrological modeling,   
> remotely sensed data, and published data sets into a freely accessible online platform. 

Aqueduct water risk framework transforms various data sources into water risk
 indicators. This project focuses on utilizing these indicators to convey the
vast spread of water scarcity. WRI provides an online tool which explores 
this data and visualizes it in a geospatial manner.

### Related work
Various resources are available where the current state of water scarcity is 
visualized in very effective manners. These plots do commendable jobs in 
conveying the risks we are facing today due to water shortage. Couple of such
visualizations are mentioned as below:

#### U.S. Drought Monitor
This geospatial visualization of current drought condition in the U.S. 
clearly convey following data:
- which states are affected by drought situation
- what is the severity of drought in these states
- if this is a log term problem or a short term problem faced by the state.  
Colors used in this visualization are easily distinguishable. They portray 
affected areas clearly. Mention of all government agencies involved in data 
collection and the author gives credibility to the data represented in this 
plot. This visualization has included Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico as well 
indicating that those islands are also affected by the drought conditions. 
Time stamp of the visualization helps to convey how recent the data is. And 
the visualization has also provided viewers a way to access additional 
information via a website.

</p>

#### Global view of duration of water scarcity
This another visualization overlays the information of water scarcity on a 
world map. It shows the number of months for which a country/regions 
experiences water scarcity. The data from the year 2916 is used for this 
visualization. Main medium of communication in this visualization is color. There is a scale
which indicates range of drought affected months represented by correponding
color. It successfully shows us which continents are affected the most by 
water scarcity.  
This visualization gives overall idea of spread of water scarcity, but it 
fails to provide us numbers behing the visual. It would benefit a lot by 
including some interactivity. Due to small scale of the graph, we don't get 
any idea about the condition of drought in a partucular country.

## Objectives
Main objective of this project is to demonstrate how wide spread the problem 
of water scarcity and drought is. Instead of relying on just colors and 
geospatial visualizations, the project aims at showcasing objectified 
attributes to convey the impact of water scarcity. This approach will help 
perform a comparative analysis of the problem faced by the world. 

1) bar charts to compare drought/scaricity
2) time trend
3) sample area - geospatial




## Data sets and visualization methods
