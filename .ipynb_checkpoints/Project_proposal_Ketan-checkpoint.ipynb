    "## Abstract \n",
    "> Water scarcity is the lack of fresh water resources to meet water demand. \n",
    "It affects every continent and was listed in 2019 by the World Economic Forum as\n",
    "one of the largest global risks in terms of potential impact over the next decade.\n",
    "Two-thirds of the global population (4 billion people) live under conditions of \n",
    "severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the year. Half a billion people in \n",
    "the world face severe water scarcity all year round. Half of the world’s \n",
    "largest cities experience water scarcity.  \n",
    "[Water scarcity Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity)\n",
    " \n",
    "Water is essential for all living beings. Human race relies on water for \n",
    "drinking needs, food, medicine, electricity, manufacturing among other needs. \n",
    "Access to clean water is a basic need for humans. Water sources and reservoirs \n",
    "have played vital role in the development of human cultures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though water plays such an important role in the existence and development \n",
    "of human beings, we are currently facing grave problems of water scarcity and \n",
    "drought risks. Communicating this  risk to wider audience is now of more \n",
    "importance than ever before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Science direct explains the problem of water scarcity by taking into \n",
    "consideration the impact of human water consumption, natural factors and \n",
    "current context of this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Water scarcity arises in situations where there is insufficient water to \n",
    "simultaneously support both human and ecosystem water needs (White, 2014). Most \n",
    "often this arises as a result of a basic lack of water (i.e., physical \n",
    "water scarcity), but it may also result from a lack of suitable infrastructure \n",
    "to provide access to what might otherwise be considered ample available water \n",
    "resources, which is referred to as economic water scarcity. Physical water \n",
    "scarcity may occur as a result of both natural phenomena (e.g., aridity, drought) \n",
    "as well as from human influences (e.g., desertification, water storage; Pereira \n",
    "et al., 2009; White, 2014), although these influences are often coupled. \n",
    "For example, the process of desertification often commences as a result of water\n",
    "overuse during periods of temporary drought; droughts are more common in arid \n",
    "regions (McMahon et al., 1992).  \n",

    " \n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Around 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water and there are huge water \n",
    "reservoirs such as rivers, lakes, glaciers around us. But still we are facing \n",
    "water scarcity. Countries such as Australia, Brazil, India, China, Syria have \n",
    "faced very severe impact of drought.[[2]](https://www.wri.org/blog/2015/06/global-tour-7-recent-droughts)\n",
    "   \n",
    "> A mere 0.014% of all water on Earth is both fresh and easily accessible. Of the remaining water, 97% is saline and \n",
    "a little less than 3% is hard to access. Technically, there is a sufficient amount of freshwater on a global scale. \n",
    "However, due to unequal distribution (exacerbated by climate change) resulting in some very wet and some very dry \n",
    "geographic locations, plus a sharp rise in global freshwater demand in recent decades driven by industry, humanity is facing a water crisis. Demand is expected to outstrip supply by 40% in 2030, if current trends continue.   \n",
    "[Water scarcity Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Water scarcity and drought have huge ecological and sociological impact. \n",
    "These conditions affect various aspects of human life, such as[[3]](http://www.eschooltoday.com/global-water-scarcity/effects-of-water-shortage.html):  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Health**  \n",
    "Water scarcity forces the community to use less clean or even contaminated \n",
    "water for drinking, cooking. This has direct impact on overall health of \n",
    "individuals of the society. Water is important for cleaning process as well. \n",
    "Shortage of water results in sanitation and cleanliness related problems.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Food production**  \n",
    "Water is used in irrigation of crops. Additionally, water is used in processing \n",
    "and production of packaged food. Water scarcity has direct impact on these \n",
    "processes resulting in lower food production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Poverty**  \n",
    "In societies where agriculture is the main industry providing jobs and income\n",
    " to individuals, the impact of water shortage is very threatening. Community \n",
    " spends most of the time in search of clean water than on betterment of the \n",

    " livelihood to the two-third of India's population which gives employment to \n",
    " the  57% of work force and is a raw material source to large number of \n",
    " industries. Impact of droughts on the lives of Indian farmers is so deep \n",
    " that it has resulted in suicides of farmers at epidemic proportions.\n",
    " Suicides among farmer community is a major concern in various state of India. \n",

    "This is geospatial visualization of current drought condition in the U.S. \n",
    "It displays the information about drought types, intesity of the drought \n",
    "and source of the data. The type and intensity of the drought is overlayed \n",

    "#### Visualization technique and design\n",
    "This geospatial visualization clearly conveys following data:\n",

    "#### Overview\n",
    "This is a visualization of duration of water scarcity in the world. It uses\n",
    "map of the world and plots indicators of scarcity with red and green colors.\n",
    "Purpose of the visualization appears to indiate which parts of the world \n",
    "are affected by water scarcity and the intensity of this scarcity. Visualization \n",
    "includes a scale to relate the color used with the period for which the region \n",
    "faced water scarcity. It succeeds in providing an overview of the water scarcity\n",
    "in various parts of the world.\n",
    "#### Explanation of the data\n",
    "The visualization uses map of the world. Data visualized on this map is count of \n",
    "months when water scarcity was greater than 100%. This count is then converted to \n",
    "categorical values by choosing ranges. Each range is assigned a color which is then \n",
    "added as a layer on top of the global map. The data from the year 2016 is used for this \n",
    "visualization.\n",
    "#### Visualization technique and design\n",
    "Main medium of communication in this visualization is color. There is a scale\n",
    "which indicates range of drought affected months represented by correponding\n",
    "color. It successfully shows us which continents are affected the most by \n",
    "water scarcity.  \n",
    "This visualization gives overall idea of spread of water scarcity, but it \n",
    "fails to provide us numbers behind the visual. It would benefit a lot by \n",
    "including some interactivity. Due to small scale of the graph, we don't get \n",
    "any idea about the condition of drought in a particular country.\n",
    "The visualization uses red and green colors which are not visible to color blind people.\n",
    "It doesn't clearly explain what does 'water scarcity greater than 100%' mean. It also \n",
    "fails to convey if this is a  permanent situation at the given countries or a \n",
    "temporary situation. Display of time trend would give us better idea of the issue.\n",
